# BlazorCats
A toy project to test Blazor wasm as a PWA.

This project do not do a lot of things. It only make a call to the [TheCatApi](https://thecatapi.com) to retrieve a list of Breeds of cats. Display them and allow to go to their respective wikipedia page when clicking on one of them.

As it is a PWA your browser should automatically tell you that you can install the website on your computer/smartphone.

A demo of this project runs on its own github pages to showcase only serving static files is necessary for using Blazor wasm.
